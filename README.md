# BankersAlgorithm

Operating Systems Fall 2023 Cole Kaminski 12/1/2023

//PURPOSE
The purpose of this project is to determine if a Banker's algorithm is in a safe state, and then determine a safe sequence if applicable.
The system includes five processes (P0 through P4) and three resources (A,B,C). There are 10 instances of resource A, 5 of resource B, and 7 of resource C.
The Banker's algorithm is intended to avoid deadlock and allocate resources safely to each process in the computer system. It is also known as a deadlock avoidance algorithm
because the operating system must determine which process sequence should be executed or waited so deadlock does not occur.
